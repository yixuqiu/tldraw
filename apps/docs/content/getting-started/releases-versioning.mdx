## How tldraw is versioned

**We do not follow SemVer**.

- Major version bumps are very rare and we reserve them for special changes that signify a paradigm shift of some kind.
- Minor version bumps are released on a regular cadence - approximately monthly. **They may contain breaking changes**. We aim to make breaking changes as minimally disruptive as possible, but tldraw is actively evolving as we add new features. We recommend updating tldraw at a similar pace to our release cadence, and be sure to check the release notes.
- Patch version bumps are for bugfixes and hotfixes that can't wait for the next cadence release.

### [v2.3.0](/releases/v2.3.0)

# The headlines

- üñºÔ∏è Images/video storage improvements/hooks
- ‚õ≤Ô∏è Font/Icons CDN
- üóúÔ∏è Images network/performance improvements/hooks (dogfooding currently, public release soon)
- ü™ó Flattening
- üìöDocumentation improvements
- üîê Security improvements

## üñºÔ∏è Images/video storage improvements/hooks

When using a local-only storage of the whiteboard, we now store the images and videos in a separate indexedDB table. This is instead of storing them as base64-encoded blobs in the room's JSON. That wasn't very performant and blew up the size of the room's JSON quite a bit. This separates out those assets into a separate retrieval mechanism for better separation-of-concerns.

## ‚õ≤Ô∏è Font/Icons CDN

We improved our out-of-the-box/batteries-included CDN for our assets (fonts/icons). We were using unpkg before but now we're just using Cloudflare directly for more fine-grained control.

## üóúÔ∏è Images network/performance improvements/hooks (dogfooding currently, public release soon)

We've been working on something we call 'level-of-detail' internally for images. We're testing this currently on tldraw.com where for higher-resolution images (over a couple megabytes), the image will get transformed to an appropriate size depending on things like your viewport, zoom level, current network speed, among other considerations. This helps with bandwidth usage and browser memory usage especially when you have multiple high-res images on the board.

## ü™ó Flattening

@steveruizok worked on adding being able to select multiple shapes and flatten them into an image. For those moments when you need to press üôè, clamp üóúÔ∏è, and squeeze things together. ü™ó

## üìö Documentation improvements

@SomeHats did a ton of unglorious work to make our documentation much more manageable. So sparkly ‚ú®

### [v2.2.0](/releases/v2.2.0)

#### Bindings

Bindings allow you to create relationships between shapes. Our default arrow shapes are a great example of this: each end of the arrow can **bind** to the shape it's pointing to. When that shape moves, so does the arrow. Before this change, it wasn't possible to build things like arrows on top of the tldraw sdk - arrows were hard-coded into the library. Now, with bindings, you can create arrows, constraint systems, visual programming environments, and much more.

Check out the [bindings guide](https://tldraw.dev/docs/editor#Bindings) for more information. ([#3326](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3326), [#3780](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3780), [#3797](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3797), [#3800](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3800), [#3871](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3871))

#### Camera constraints

You can now limit the camera in tldraw to a certain fixed area of the canvas. This is useful for creating experiences that don't quite fit the "infinite canvas" paradigm: document annotators, image editor, slideshow creators, etc.

See the [camera constraints guide](https://tldraw.dev/docs/editor#Camera-options) for more information. ([#3282](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3282), [#3747](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3747), [#3814](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3814), [#3828](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3828), [#3844](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3844), [#3863](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3863))

#### Configurable options prop

You can now override many options which were previously hard-coded constants. Pass an `options` prop into the tldraw component to change the maximum number of pages, grid steps, or other previously hard-coded values.

See [`TldrawOptions`](https://tldraw.dev/reference/editor/TldrawOptions) for details. ([#3799](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3799), [#3900](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3900))

#### Breaking changes

- The `canBind` flag now accepts an options object instead of just the shape in question. If you're relying on its arguments, check out [`TLShapeUtilCanBindOpts`](https://tldraw.dev/reference/editor/TLShapeUtilCanBindOpts) for its replacement.
- `editor.sideEffects.registerBatchCompleteHandler` has been replaced with `editor.sideEffects.registerOperationCompleteHandler` ([#3748](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3748))
- `editor.getArrowInfo(shape)` has been replaced with `getArrowInfo(editor, shape)`
- `editor.getArrowsBoundTo(shape)` has been removed. Instead, use `editor.getBindingsToShape(shape, 'arrow')` and follow the `fromId` of each binding to the corresponding arrow shape
- These types have moved from `@tldraw/editor` to `tldraw`:
  - `TLArcInfo`
  - `TLArrowInfo`
  - `TLArrowPoint`
- The `start` and `end` properties on `TLArrowShape` no longer have `type: point | binding`. Instead, they're always a point, which may be out of date if a binding exists. To check for & retrieve arrow bindings, use `getArrowBindings(editor, shape)` instead.
- `getArrowTerminalsInArrowSpace` must be passed a `TLArrowBindings` as a third argument: `getArrowTerminalsInArrowSpace(editor, shape, getArrowBindings(editor, shape))`
- The following types have been renamed:
  - `ShapeProps` -> `RecordProps`
  - `ShapePropsType` -> `RecordPropsType`
  - `TLShapePropsMigrations` -> `TLPropsMigrations`
  - `SchemaShapeInfo` -> `SchemaPropsInfo`

##### Undo/redo

###### 1. History Options

Previously, some (not all!) commands accepted a history options object with `squashing`, `ephemeral`, and `preserveRedoStack` flags. Squashing enabled/disabled a memory optimisation (storing individual commands vs squashing them together). Ephemeral stopped a command from affecting the undo/redo stack at all. Preserve redo stack stopped commands from wiping the redo stack. These flags were never available consistently - some commands had them and others didn't.

In this version, most of these flags have been removed. `squashing` is gone entirely (everything squashes & does so much faster than before). There were a couple of commands that had a special default - for example, `updateInstanceState` used to default to being `ephemeral`. Those maintain the defaults, but the options look a little different now - `{ephemeral: true}` is now `{history: 'ignore'}` and `{preserveRedoStack: true}` is now `{history: 'record-preserveRedoStack'}`.

If you were previously using these options in places where they've now been removed, you can use wrap them with `editor.history.ignore(fn)` or `editor.history.batch(fn, {history: 'record-preserveRedoStack'})`. For example,

```ts
editor.nudgeShapes(..., { ephemeral: true })
```

can now be written as

```ts
editor.history.ignore(() => {
    editor.nudgeShapes(...)
})
```

###### 2. Automatic recording

Previously, only commands (e.g. `editor.updateShapes` and things that use it) were added to the undo/redo stack. Everything else (e.g. `editor.store.put`) wasn't. Now, _everything_ that touches the store is recorded in the undo/redo stack (unless it's part of `mergeRemoteChanges`). You can use `editor.history.ignore(fn)` as above if you want to make other changes to the store that aren't recorded - this is short for `editor.history.batch(fn, {history: 'ignore'})`

When upgrading to this version of tldraw, you shouldn't need to change anything unless you're using `store.put`, `store.remove`, or `store.applyDiff` outside of `store.mergeRemoteChanges`. If you are, you can preserve the functionality of those not being recorded by wrapping them either in `mergeRemoteChanges` (if they're multiplayer-related) or `history.ignore` as appropriate.

###### 3. Side effects

Before this diff, any changes in side-effects weren't captured by the undo-redo stack. This was actually the motivation for this change in the first place! But it's a pretty big change, and if you're using side effects we recommend you double-check how they interact with undo/redo before/after this change. To get the old behaviour back, wrap your side effects in `editor.history.ignore`.

###### 4. Mark options

Previously, `editor.mark(id)` accepted two additional boolean parameters: `onUndo` and `onRedo`. If these were set to false, then when undoing or redoing we'd skip over that mark and keep going until we found one with those values set to true. We've removed those options - if you're using them, let us know and we'll figure out an alternative!

#### Improvements

- Nicer rendering for bookmarks without preview images. ([#3856](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3856))
- Improve undo/redo UX around image cropping. ([#3891](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3891))
- Disable toolbar items that don't work when not in select mode. ([#3819](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3819))
- ‚ù§Ô∏è We've added a heart shape to the geo shape set. ([#3787](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3787))
- Detect coarse pointers (ie touch) more reliably. ([#3572](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3572), [#3656](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3656), [#3795](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3795))
- Reduce padding when zooming to fit. ([#3798](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3798))
- Increase the default limit of shapes per page from 2000 to 4000 ([#3716](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3716))
- Unify list of accepted image types and expand to include webp, webm, apng, & avif. ([#3730](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3730))
- Prunes unused assets when loading a `.tldr` file. ([#3689](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3689))
- Improve handling of mouse-type devices that support pressure, e.g. wacom tablets. They now use the same freehand options as true pen-type inputs. ([#3639](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3639))
- Separate the text align property for text shapes and labels. Text shapes are now left-aligned by default. ([#3627](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3627))
- Add desmos graph embed type. ([#3608](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3608))
- Tweak default gap value to be consistent with sticky note gaps. ([#3606](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3606))

#### API changes

- Add `editor.blur` method. ([#3875](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3875))
- Better defaults for `createTLStore`. ([#3886](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3886))
- Add `getSnapshot` and `loadSnapshot` for easier loading/saving of tldraw documents. Read more [here](https://tldraw.dev/docs/persistence#State-Snapshots). ([#3811](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3811))
- Add `select` option to `Editor.groupShapes` and `Editor.ungroupShapes`. ([#3690](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3690))
- `InFrontOfTheCanvas` now has access to the editor's UI context ([#3782](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3782))
- `useEditor` and other context-based hooks will now throw an error when used out-of-context, instead of returning a fake value. ([#3750](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3750))
- Expose migrations, validators, and versions from tlschema. Previously, we weren't exporting migrations & validators for our default shapes. This meant that it wasn't possible to make your own tlschema with both our default shapes and some of your own (e.g. for custom multiplayer). This fixes that by exposing all the migrations, validators, and versions from tlschema, plus `defaultShapeSchemas` which can be passed directly to `createTLSchema`.([#3613](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3613))

### [v2.1.3](/releases/v2.1.3)

#### Expose migrations, validators, and versions from tlschema ([#3613](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3613))

Previously, we weren't exporting migrations & validators for our default shapes. This meant that it wasn't possible to make your own tlschema with both our default shapes and some of your own (e.g. for custom multiplayer). This fixes that by exposing all the migrations, validators, and versions from tlschema, plus `defaultShapeSchemas` which can be passed directly to `createTLSchema`

### [v2.1.2](/releases/v2.1.2)

#### Revert "[signia] Smart dirty checking of active computeds (#3516)" ([#3611](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3611))

This performance optimisation introduced a regression where sometimes computed caches wouldn't get invalidated at the correct time, leading to stale data causing crashes. We're reverting the change for now.

### [v2.1.1](/releases/v2.1.1)

#### fix migration exports ([#3594](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3594))

We were missing an export `createShapePropsMigrationIds`, part of the new migrations API introduced in [v2.1.0](https://tldraw.dev/releases/v2.1.0). This release fixes that, and also adds exports for a few extra APIs that we were using in our examples, but weren't exporting properly: `defaultEditorAssetUrls`, `PORTRAIT_BREAKPOINT`, `useDefaultColorTheme`, & `getPerfectDashProps`
